## How the Health Check and GitHub Actions Pipeline Work

### Health Check

The `/health` endpoint of the Flask app is used to check the connection to the Redis service. When you visit `http://localhost:8000/health`, the following happens:
- The Flask app attempts to connect to the Redis server using the environment variables `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If the connection to Redis is successful, the server responds with a **200 HTTP status**.
- If there is any issue connecting to Redis, the server responds with a **500 HTTP status**.

This endpoint is important for monitoring the health of the application, especially in production environments where Redis is used to store the visit count.

### GitHub Actions Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline is set up to automate testing whenever a pull request is created to the `main` branch. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout the Code**: It checks out the repository code to set up the environment.
2. **Build and Start the Services**: The `docker-compose up --build -d` command is used to build the images and start the services in detached mode.
3. **Verify Health Endpoint**: The pipeline waits for the services to start and verifies that the `/health` endpoint returns HTTP 200 by performing a `curl` request to `http://localhost:8000/health`.
4. **Clean Up**: Once the tests are done, the pipeline runs `docker-compose down` to stop and remove the containers.

This ensures that every change made to the repository is automatically verified before being merged into the main branch.

## Final Notes

- Make sure to push your changes to GitHub to trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline.
- Always ensure that the Redis container is running and properly configured to persist data across restarts, using volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
